### Article 1
 -  Article name.
 - "A Feature on Zoom Secretly Displayed Data From People’s LinkedIn Profiles"

-  Reference or article citation.
 - Krolik, Aaron, and Natasha Singer. “A Feature on Zoom Secretly Displayed Data
 From People's LinkedIn Profiles.” The New York Times, The New York Times,
 2 Apr. 2020, www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/technology/zoom-linkedin-data.html.

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - Zoom had been using a data-mining feature called "LinkedIn Sales Navigator
 that allowed participants in a meeting to secretly gain access to other users'
 LinkedIn profile data without requesting the permission of those participants
 during the meeting or notifying them that someone had access to this information.
 This personal information is still sent even if no one in the meeting had
 activated it.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - I think the ethical concern is while Zoom tries to provide a welcoming environment
 to help people maintain their resiliency during crises such as the Coronavirus
 pandemic, their platform can also act as invasion of privacy by allowing users
 to peek into colleagues' living rooms, kitchens, or other areas that they may
 deem to be private. This can reveal a lot more about an individual than we may
 think. Users are also not aware that this is happening, so it is seen as "unfair
 and quite deceptive" as stated in the article.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The data that is being manipulated is the personal information of the participants
 in a Zoom meeting. Zoom automatically sends this information to its data mining
 tool even if no one has activated the feature.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - The data-mining tool is available to Zoom users that have subscribed to a
 LinkedIn service that deals with sales prospecting. Once a user has activated
 this feature, he/she will be able to quickly access information such as someone's
 location, employer names, and job titles that might exist on their LinkedIn
 profiles by clicking on the LinkedIn icon next to their names. Even if someone
 were to type a pseudonym in place of their name, the tool would still be able to
 match them to their LinkedIn profile, thus overriding efforts to make their name
 private.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - Corporate sales and customer relations management departments have a lot to
 gain from this form of analysis because profiling customers and targeting clients
 are regular practices for them. At the same time, Zoom users are at a loss
 because their privacy is at stake. This tool can be used during a meeting
 without even alerting participants, which was the subject of criticism from
 privacy experts.


### Article 2
 -  Article name.
 - "The Houston Astros And The Ethical Use Of Data And Analytics"

-  Reference or article citation.
 - Davenport, Tom. “The Houston Astros And The Ethical Use Of Data And Analytics.”
 Forbes, Forbes Magazine, 4 Mar. 2020, www.forbes.com/sites/tomdavenport/2020/03/04/the-houston-astros-and-the-ethical-use-of-data-and-analytics/#9475c966f8f6.

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The Houston Astros used an illegal approach to steal pitch signs from catchers
 that would hitters to anticipate what type of pitch was coming at them. The author
 of this article also gives some advice on how to avoid crossing the ethical line
 when it comes to collecting data and provides an explanation as to how one can
 pursue data and analytics too far.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - I think the ethical concern is that by obtaining this feed, the game no longer
 becomes fair. By being able to anticipate what pitch will come at the batter,
 the opposing team will find it more difficult to come up with a unique strategy.
 This is seen as an inappropriate collection and use of data as it is supposed to
 be used to challenge a call. The Astros will be able to win more games
 (this technology even aided them to win the World Series in 2017) and it
 essentially eliminates the idea of playing a "fair game".

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The data that is being manipulated is the video feed that is coming from the
 center-field during every game. The Astros have been using the technology from
 the video replay system in order to anticipate what type of pitch the opposing
 pitcher was going to throw so that they could act accordingly.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - Major League Baseball usually gives managers one chance to challenge a particular
 call on the field using a video replay system accompanied by a video review room
 for each team. The coach for the Astros would usually call the video review rooms
 to get these pitch signs and occasionally these signs would be relayed through
 a text message to the phone of someone in the dugout or the smartwatch of a staff
 member. The bench coach eventually had a television monitor installed on the dugout
 that transmitted the feed from the center-field camera for the players to watch.
 The players then signaled the batter to get ready for a curveball or another
 off-speed pitch.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - The Astros stand to gain something from the analysis of the feed from the
 center-field because they are able to anticipate their opponent's next move and
use that to their advantage. Their opponents have a lot to lose because it could
deprive them of winning the game or even championship that they may have deserved
to win if they were in fact the better team. In some regard the Astros have also
lost something despite gaining a competitive advantage. They received a $5 million
penalty and docked several top draft picks. The team even received criticism
from players and fans alike saying that their World Series title should have
been revoked.
