 - "A Feature on Zoom Secretly Displayed Data From People’s LinkedIn Profiles"

-  Reference or article citation.
 - Krolik, Aaron, and Natasha Singer. “A Feature on Zoom Secretly Displayed Data
 From People's LinkedIn Profiles.” The New York Times, The New York Times,
 2 Apr. 2020, www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/technology/zoom-linkedin-data.html.

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - Zoom had been using a data-mining feature called "LinkedIn Sales Navigator
 that allowed participants in a meeting to secretly gain access to other users'
 LinkedIn profile data without requesting the permission of those participants
 during the meeting or notifying them that someone had access to this information.
 This personal information is still sent even if no one in the meeting had
 activated it.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - I think the ethical concern is while Zoom tries to provide a welcoming environment
 to help people maintain their resiliency during crises such as the Coronavirus
 pandemic, their platform can also act as invasion of privacy by allowing users
 to peek into colleagues' living rooms, kitchens, or other areas that they may
 deem to be private. This can reveal a lot more about an individual than we may
 think. Users are also not aware that this is happening, so it is seen as "unfair
 and quite deceptive" as stated in the article.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The data that is being manipulated is the personal information of the participants
 in a Zoom meeting. Zoom automatically sends this information to its data mining
 tool even if no one has activated the feature.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - The data-mining tool is available to Zoom users that have subscribed to a
 LinkedIn service that deals with sales prospecting. Once a user has activated
 this feature, he/she will be able to quickly access information such as someone's
 location, employer names, and job titles that might exist on their LinkedIn
 profiles by clicking on the LinkedIn icon next to their names. Even if someone
 were to type a pseudonym in place of their name, the tool would still be able to
 match them to their LinkedIn profile, thus overriding efforts to make their name
 private.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - Corporate sales and customer relations management departments have a lot to
 gain from this form of analysis because profiling customers and targeting clients
 are regular practices for them. At the same time, Zoom users are at a loss
 because their privacy is at stake. This tool can be used during a meeting
 without even alerting participants, which was the subject of criticism from
 privacy experts.
